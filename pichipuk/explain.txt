pichipuk was only spotted twice, however they send super creepy messages to anyone who clearly identifies as female. A few examples are on this folder, to keep in mind the messages he sends are the same fkr everyone (who identifies as female to them) which makes me fall under the assumption this is mostly a script to attempt to get a romantic/sexual partner using Among Us.
